Description
Create an interactive art work that expresses something about you. It could, for example, showcase your personal style, say something about where you grew up, tell a story, or communicate something about your UNM experience.

Here are a few ideas of things you could create, to help get you started:
//An interactive logo or drawing of your name
//A NM landscape
//A drawing of the ABQ skyline
//A self-portrait
//A fabric pattern
//A drawing of a favorite cartoon character
