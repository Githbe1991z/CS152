  Java is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) language. While you will be working some with Objects, CS152 is not a course on OOP. Experienced Java programmers with solid skills should skip CS152 and take CS251 (Intermediate Programming). CS251 is also currently taught in Java and its primary emphasis is on understanding, developing and applying OOP skills.

  CS152 is taught using the Java programming language. More specifically, this class will use the Processing platform, a Java programming tool that makes it easy to build interactive programs and to generate and manipulate media including images, text, and sound. You will also learn how to install and work with other Java platforms.
